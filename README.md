# Introduction
This is a fork of the Mazda Connected Services integration originally written by bdr99 that has been packaged into a HACS compatible custom integration. The original code was part of the Home Assistant core integrations prior to a DMCA takedown notice issue by Mazda Motor Corporation.  It should restore all functionality previously available in the core integration.

# Installation

## With HACS

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Download the integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Manual
Copy the `mazda` directory, from `custom_components` in this repository,
and place it inside your Home Assistant Core installation's `custom_components` directory. Restart Home Assistant prior to moving on to the `Setup` section.

`Note`: If installing manually, in order to be alerted about new releases, you will need to subscribe to releases from this repository.
